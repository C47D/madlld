    Release notes


This program is a "how to" about libmad's low-level API. The intended
use of this program is to serve as tutorial or demonstration for
programers wiling to learn how the curently undocumented library API
can be used. As a side effect the program can be used to decode MPEG
audio streams to raw PCM samples.

Madllc was written on an unix system but as only the standard ansi C
library was used no system dependencies are expected. The hosting
operating system should only be able to provide standard streams
redirection. The program structure is very simple: it reads an audio
mpeg stream from stdin and writes raw big-endian stereo 16 bits
samples on stdout. The source code is heavily commented, you are
advised to read them as that's were this package purpose is.


==============================================================================
Release status
==============================================================================

This first release was tested against mad versions 0.14.0b, 0.14.1b,
and 0.14.2b. There is no known bug.


==============================================================================
Installation
==============================================================================

This program is distributed in source code only, you shall build it
first. Follow the instructions bellow to build and install malld on
unix systems. 

1. Configure the build process by editing the Makefile. Inlined
   comments will guide you there.

2. Run "make".

3. Test the built binaries by placing an audio MPEG stream in the
   build directory as a file named "test.mp3". If sox(1) is intalled
   on your system them type "make test". Else type "make test.cdr"
   and use any tools of your choice to check the PCM samples that
   were store in the file "test.cdr".

4. If step 3 suceeded then you're ready to install the program with
   "make install".

5. If your brand new installation required some changes to the program,
   please send unified diffs to the author (see the Contact section
   bellow).

6. If your brand new installation was done on an operating system not
   listed in this document or against an also unlisted mad version,
   please report your system details/versions to the author (see the
   Contact section bellow).


==============================================================================
Contact
==============================================================================

Questions, bug reports, patches, etc. are welcome. Please mail your
queries to < madlld at phoe dot frmug dot org >. Note that things such
as HTML e-mails, word documents, etc. will be blindly discarded.
