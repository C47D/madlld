.Sh NAME
.Nm madlld
.Nd Mad low-level decoder/demonstration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm madlld
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm madlld
reads an audio MPEG stream from stdin and outputs raw big-endian
16-bit stereo PCM samples on stdout. The decoded stream
characteristics are printed on stderr. On completion the number of
decoded frames and the duration of the stream are also printed on
stderr.

No options are available.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If an error occurs, a message is printed on stderr, if that error is
fatal then
.Nm madlld
exits with a non zero return value.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To play an audio audio MPEG stream:
.RS
.nf
\fB	$ madlld <test.mp3 | play -t cdr -\fP
.fi
.RE

Convert an audio MPEG stream encoded with a 32 kHz sample rate to an
AIFF archive:
.RS
.nf
\fB	$ madlld <test.mp3 | sox -r 32000 -t cdr - test.aiff\fP
.fi
.RE
